# redux-next-js

Redux Toolkit used for handle states / workflows. Here we explore RTK store, slice ( reducers [state, action (payload)] ) etc.

Using this we make a counter with increment and decrement functionality and payload system also implemented here.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
